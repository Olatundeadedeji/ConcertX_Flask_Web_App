#  ConcertX with React & Flask

## Introduction

The ConcertX web app is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. Executive Producer is saddled with the responsibility to create a system to simplify and streamline processes within the app within the dashboard.


## Getting Started

### Base URL

You can run the app locally or in Heroku:

- Locally: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### Installing Dependencies

Python 3.9
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python here (https://docs.python.org/3/)

PIP Dependencies
Install dependencies by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all of the required packages within the requirements.txt file.

_All needed variables are saved in setup.sh_ and .env

### Run the server locally:

Create a local database using postgresql, run the following:

```
Update the postgresql connection strings in the models appropriately
```

Then run the app using this command:
`set FLASK_APP=app.py`
`set FLASK_ENV=development`
`flask run`

### Authentication:

I used Auth0 tokens for the authentication. There are three roles for the casting agency:

**Casting Assistant**

- Can view actors and movies

**Casting Director**

- Can view actors and movies

- Add or delete an actor from the database

- Modify actors or movies

**Executive Producer**

- Can view actors and movies

- Add or delete an actor from the database

- Modify actors or movies

- Add or delete a movie from the database

## Test

You can test the app by running the test_app.py or using Postman collection.

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "Resource Not Found"
}
```

- 404: Resource Not Found
